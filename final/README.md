# Personal-Website

Since GitHub Pages is only capable of hosting static pages and this website requires PHP, you cannot simply open the website in a browser and it cannot be hosted on GitHub! The site is currently live using a Heroku server at www.daviddomalik.com. This code is for viewing purposes only and any attempts to run it without first uploading to a dynamic server will fail. Please view the live deployment of the site to see the code in action.
